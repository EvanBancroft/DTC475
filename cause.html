				Housing insecurity may happen to a student for a variety of reasons, such as previous housing situations, socioeconomic status, or belonging to a minority group that is at higher risk for experiencing discriminatory housing practices. There is no single image of what a student facing housing insecurity may look like or what road got them there. Below are some of the possible causes for housing insecurity among higher education students.

	<button class="collapse"><h1>FINANCIAL</h1> </button>

	<div class="paragraph">	
		<h2 class="inside">Cost of Education</h2>
		<img src="financialCost.jpg" style="width: 100%;height: 400px;">
		<p class="inside">
			The cost of college can be a contributing factor to a student’s ability to access safe and stable housing. While students might have access to grants or scholarships, they often aren’t enough to cover the full cost of college and student loans, in addition to a job, will be needed to make ends meet.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[4]</a> Contributing to this issue is what makes up these estimated costs of attending college.
		</p>
		<p class="inside">
			
			There is a disparity between the cost of attendance (COA) and the actual cost of living. Universities will provide an estimated COA, which often includes tuition, fees, and living costs, such as room and board. The living costs make up the majority of the COA total and can vary from college to college, even those in the same county. The COA total can affect a student’s eligibility for financial aid. In a recent study, they found that 20% of the surveyed colleges consistently reported living-cost allowances 20% below a modest standard of living.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[10]</a>   
		</p>
		<p class="inside">
			If students are not able to adequately plan for the cost of living, it could lead to housing insecurity while pursuing their education. Although student loans might be able to help offset the strain of the cost of living, the debt loans leave behind can be crippling long after completing a degree. Often, students pursue higher education to get careers that will help them get out of poverty.

		<button class="collapse"><h1>MINORITY GROUPS</h1> </button>

	<div class="paragraph">	
		<h2 class="inside">Discrimination Within Housing</h2>
		<img src="minority.jpg" style="width: 100%;height: 280px;">
		<p class="inside">Housing insecurity disproportionately affects minority groups. In the United States, 40% of the homeless population is African American. Indigenous populations, whether Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders, make up less than 5% of the general population but make up more than 10% of the homeless population.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[13]</a>   </p>

		
		<p class="inside">
			Students that belong to minority groups, including those with disabilities, are at a higher risk for facing housing insecurity. This includes the possibility of facing housing discrimination. Housing discrimination against minority groups is still prevalent within the United States.
		</p>


		<p class="inside">			
		In 2017, there were 8,186 complaints filed with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Fair Housing Assistance Program. Of those, 59% were for discrimination against disability and 26% were for discrimination against race. 
		</p>
		<p class="inside">
			
			Over 2,000 of the complaints were pertaining to discriminatory refusal to rent.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[12]</a>  Other groups often discriminated against are those belonging to the LGBTQ+ community, those of different nationalities and different religious affiliations.

		<button class="collapse"><h1>PREVIOUS HOME LIFE</h1> </button>
	
	<div class="paragraph">	
		<h2 class="inside">Perpetual Insecurity</h2>
		<img src="houseIm.jpg" style="width: 100%;height: 400px;">
		<p class="inside">In some cases, students pursuing higher education come from environments that would already be defined as housing insecure. This might include high school students who are experiencing housing insecurity or are coming out of the foster care system. During the 2017-2018 school year, there were 40,112 homeless youth enrolled in public schools in Washington State alone. </p>

		<p class="inside">Across the nation there is a reported 1,504,544 homeless youth in public schools.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[11]</a> This includes students that are living in shelters, couch surfing, or are unsheltered. There are also students that are considered unaccompanied, meaning that they are not living with their parents or another guardian. </p>

		<p class="inside">Students that wish to pursue higher education coming from these environments might not be able to improve their housing: there are many barriers to successfully pursuing a higher education for students already facing housing insecurity. This might include the inability to financially live independently and safely, as well as receive the proper guidance while applying for college.</p>

		<p class="inside"> Many students are not aware of legislation that is designed to help them, including the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, which allows for college testing and admissions fees to be waived for students that are housing insecure. While the McKinney-Vento Act ensures that every school district has a person in charge of making sure that homeless students get access to college opportunities, if a student is highly mobile, meaning they move from school to school or house to house frequently, they could easily fall through the cracks.</p>
