		<p class="introduction" style="line-height: 2;width: 70%;">Students facing housing insecurity are presented with many hurdles to overcome in their pursuit of a degree. Social stigmas, mental health and financial stresses can all heavily affect a student’s ability to succeed in school, all of which can be hindered by struggling to meet basic needs. Below shared are firsthand accounts of housing insecure students pursuing higher education.</p>

	<button class="collapse"><h1>DEALING WITH HOUSING INSECURITY</h1> </button>

	<div class="paragraph">	
		<h2 class="inside">An Uphill Battle</h2>
		
		<p class="inside">Housing insecurity among college students is nothing new with rates continuing to increase to this day. Some people may be able to imagine what housing insecurity as a student may seem like while others may truly know someone who is fighting this very battle.</p> 
		
		<p class="inside">These struggles cannot be explained any better than from those that have truly experienced this growing issue. Zeneb, a 30-year-old college student from South Africa, had to move from her apartment and could not find another affordable place to live.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[6]</a> “Whenever I’m doing something or reading something . . . my mind just goes straight to the main subject in my personal life, which is finding a place where to live,” Zeneb comments about the daily struggle on finding the balance to attend her studies efficiently as well as making her way through life with no security.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[6]</a></p> 
		
		<p class="inside">Many of these homeless students are in the given situation due to their attempt in escaping their past life to find a better one; Louis is one of these students in that situation.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[6]</a> As an African-American male attending community college in the Pacific Northwest, which holds as one of the most expensive places to live in the United States, Louis comments how “you have to really take care of yourself first[.]<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[6]</a> And for some people going to school is their route off the streets or out of an abusive home or things like that. It is their route, but it’s like a mountain.”<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[6]</a> America’s educational system is absolutely a mountain with many financial obstacles from extremely expensive books to vast expenses toward housing.</p>
	</div>	

		<button class="collapse"><h1>FINANCIAL REALITIES</h1> </button>

	<div class="paragraph">	
		<h2 class="inside">A Disjointed System</h2>
		<p class="inside">There is no argument on the fact that higher education is no cheap matter in the United States from textbooks to credits purchased per semester or quarter. Some colleges or universities recognize the various backgrounds of their students and aid in purchasing their education through scholarships. Although, whether these scholarships immensely provide educational financial aid, there are still the financial struggles of everyday life that distract housing insecure students from their studies and sometimes force others to drop out.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[5]</a> Daily financial needs include food, shelter or a place to sleep, and sometimes even childcare.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[5]</a></p>

		<p class="inside"> Many universities provide food options on campus such as a food bank, but a common issue is that many housing insecure students are too embarrassed to seek help or even identify as being housing insecure which heavily prevents universities from having an accurate knowledge of the population size of housing insecurity among students.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[5]</a> Another form of aid available to housing insecure college students includes federal, but even this aid fails to truly help; in fact, federal aid tends to make the situations worse for students attempting to better their lives through education.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[8]</a> Most aid does not come near enough to cover the net costs of education even after all grants have been processed. Much of these students are low-income workers on top of their education which studies have shown to lead to a lack of food and security.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[8]</a> These material hardships contribute greatly to a lack of the ability to learn and obtain the information being given in a classroom.</p>

		<p class="inside">There must be a coordination between college systems and social safety nets in order to produce successful students that are able to climb out of their housing insecure situations.</p>

	<button class="collapse"><h1>GENDER/SEXUALITY</h1> </button>

	<div class="paragraph">	
		<h2 class="inside">Additional Discrimination</h2>
		<p class="inside">A portion of college students facing housing insecurity includes members of the LGBT community that are more at risk for greater health issues and social issues due to discrimination of their sexual identity and preferences; an estimate of 36% of LGB report facing some sort of harassment on campus for their sexual orientation.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[9]</a></p>

		<p class="inside"> In a crucial time of development and establishing self-confidence, housing insecurity among youthful students already causes far too many complications for a young individual, let alone the addition of discrimination for their sexual orientation. Students that identify with the LGBT community and are part of the housing insecure community attending college come from all sorts of backgrounds, but studies show that youth with a history of same-sex are far more likely to run away from home and their families than youth who identify to be attracted to the opposite sex.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[9]</a> Facing a lack of emotional support from both family and peers often leads to more adverse mental health issues which further prevents success in the educational system.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[9]</a> As a form of coping with the stress of the added stigma of sexual orientation as well as educational stress, LGBT is far more likely to experience higher levels of substance abuse and abuse.</p>

		<p class="inside">On top of the normal stress that housing insecure college students must face such as searching for food and security, the LGBT tend to face much further and harsher stress battling the housing insecurity life during schooling due to discrimination and humiliation.<a class="citationLink" href="citation.html">[9]</a> Many universities are opening their arms to this population through support groups and even lending housing since the LGBT tend to face further discrimination in insecure housing.</p>
